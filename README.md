**mapXplore** is a modular application that imports data extracted of the sqlmap to PostgreSQL or SQLite database.

Its main features are:

* Import of information extracted from sqlmap to PostgreSQL or SQLite for subsequent querying.
* Sanitized information, which means that at the time of import, it decodes or transforms unreadable information into readable information.
* Search for information in all tables, such as passwords, users, and desired information.
* Automatic export of information stored in **base64**, such as:
    * Word, Excel, PowerPoint files
    * .zip files
    * Text files or plain text information
    * Images
    * PDF

* Filter tables and columns by criteria.
* Filter by different types of hash functions without requiring prior conversion.
* Export relevant information to Excel or HTML

# Installation
